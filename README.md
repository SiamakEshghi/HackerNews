# Siamak Eshghi Hacker News

**Development process**: I usually start the project by reading the documentation of the API I'm going to consume in the app and I started to make and test queries for the pages using https://hn.algolia.com/api.
After gathering the information, I started the project by installing all tools I need and tested before.
I continue with coding.
Next step is doing some integration and unit tests and testing on different browsers and different size devices to be sure it is fully responsive.
At the end I refactore my code.
